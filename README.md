##Overview
This is a collection of javascript web applications for the GURPS pen and paper role playing system owned by [Steve Jackson Games](http://www.sjgames.com).

Fully Functional Tools Include:

* Dice Roller
* GM Control Sheet (currently beta - i.e. feature complete, probably has bugs - everywhere )

The roadmap for these tools include:

* Character Creator
* Starship Creator
* Mass Battles Assistant

You should be able to double-click on the HTML file in any web modern web browser to use the tools.

##Requirements
Any modern web browser should work... there does seem to be an issue with event.preventDefault() in ie9, but this is not an issue in ie10 (and seems to work great in ie10+). Not sure if I want to even bother trying to fix ie9.

##Thanks
Many thanks to [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) for providing their Halflings for users of [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) for free!
